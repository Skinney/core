{-| The array in this module is implemented as a tree with a high branching
factor (number of elements at each level). In comparision, the `Dict` has
a branching factor of 2 (left or right).

The higher the branching factor, the more elements are stored at each level.
This makes writes slower (more to copy per level), but reads faster
(fewer traversals). In practice, 32 is a good compromise.

The branching factor has to be a power of two (8, 16, 32, 64...). This is
because we use the index to tell us which path to take when navigating the
tree, and we do this by dividing it into several smaller numbers (see
`shiftStep` documentation). By dividing the index into smaller numbers, we
will always get a range which is a power of two (2 bits gives 0-3, 3 gives
0-7, 4 gives 0-15...).
-}
branchFactor : Int
branchFactor =

{-| A number is made up of several bits. For bitwise operations in javascript,
numbers are treated as 32-bits integers. The number 1 is represented by 31
zeros, and a one. The important thing to take from this, is that a 32-bit
integer has enough information to represent several smaller numbers.

For a branching factor of 32, a 32-bit index has enough information to store 6
different numbers in the range of 0-31 (5 bits), and one number in the range of
0-3 (2 bits). This means that the tree of an array can have, at most, a depth
of 7.

An index essentially functions as a map. To figure out which branch to take at
any given level of the tree, we need to shift (or move) the correct amount of
bits so that those bits are at the front. We can then perform a bitwise and to
read which of the 32 branches to take.

The `shiftStep` specifices how many bits are required to represent the branching
factor.

{-| Construct an array with the information in a given builder.

Due to the nature of `List` the list of nodes in a builder will often
be in reverse order (that is, the first leaf of the array is the last
node in the node list). This function therefore allows the caller to
specify if the node list should be reversed before building the array.
